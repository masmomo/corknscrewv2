        At CORK&SCREW, we understand that temperature and humidity is an important consideration as the wineâ€™s quality is affected by the way a bottle is stored. For that reason, we maintain the quality of our wines by keeping a constant temperature of 18-20 degrees Celsius for red wine, 8-10 degrees Celsius for white wines, And a crisp 6 degrees Celsius for ice and dessert wines. All wines are kept at a humidity of 60% - 70%. Quality degradation of our wines is something we take very seriously; therefore, all of our wines are stored away from direct sunlight, and kept at their proper humidity level.
